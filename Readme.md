An experimental project on making a peer-to-peer data transmission via sockets in swift. This idea refers to APPs like [SHAREit](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id725215120?mt=8), [å¿«ç‰™](https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/kuai-yazapya/id576309271?mt=8).

The orginal verison was written in Objective-C. The demo app has been tested and can share a video to an Android app made by my colleague.ðŸ™‚
